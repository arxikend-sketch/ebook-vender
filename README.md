Getting Started with Mobile Data Selling App

This project was prepared to manage and sell mobile data packages (MB/GB) quickly, efficiently, and in real-time.

This system can help you offer data packages across different carriers, register purchases, track deliveries, and organize customer requests smoothly.

Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

npm start

Runs the mobile data sales dashboard in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view and manage data packages, customers, and transactions.

The page will reload automatically as you update information.
You may also see any system warnings in the console.

npm test

Launches the data-transaction test runner in interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more details about testing your sales operations and package delivery logic.

npm run build

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It bundles the mobile data sales system in production mode and optimizes it for best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include hashes.
Your platform is ready to be deployed and used to sell data packages to customers!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the default configuration of the sales system — pricing logic, carrier rules, delivery modules, or UI — you can eject at any time.

This command will copy every configuration file and all dependencies (like Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you full control over all mobile-data-related behaviors.

All commands except eject will continue to work normally, but they will use your custom configurations.
At this point, you fully control how your data-selling platform behaves.

You never need to use eject.
The default setup works perfectly for small and medium data-selling operations, and you shouldn’t feel pressured to change it.
However, we understand some businesses require deeper customization.
